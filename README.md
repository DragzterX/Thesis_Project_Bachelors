# A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach with ConvNeXt and Vision Transformer for Detecting Schizophrenia in fMRI Scans
Thesis Project for Bachelors in Computer Science.
We achieved an average accuracy of 91.06%, F1 score of 0.91, and AUC-ROC of 0.96.
The model needs to be run on a large fMRI dataset to see if the results change for the better or worse.
